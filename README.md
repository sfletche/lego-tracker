## Getting Started

* Fork or clone this repository.

* Used any of the following [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) commands which will also trigger frontend associated npm scripts.

```
    sbt clean           # Clean existing build artifacts

    sbt stage           # Build your application from your projectâ€™s source directory

    sbt run             # Run both backend and frontend builds in watch mode

    sbt dist            # Build both backend and frontend sources into a single distribution artifact

    sbt test            # Run both backend and frontend unit tests
```

**Note: _On production build all the front end React build artifacts will be copied to the `public` folder._**

## Can be used to implement any front end/ui build!

* Simply replace the ui directory with the build of your choice
* Make output directory ROOT/public/
